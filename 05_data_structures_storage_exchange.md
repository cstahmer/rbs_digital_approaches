What Structures and Storage and Exchange Formats
=============


As digital Bibliographers we work both with digitized versions of original artifacts, and, digitally delivered metadata about those artifacts. Metadata, a collection of data that describes and gives information about an object or other data has been used to help organize and facilitate search and discovery of resources since long before the first computers. The original library card catalog was a complex, analog, metadata system.

Today, most library and museum catalogs collect, store, and deliver metadata digitally. And the digital catalogues of cultural heritage institutions provide rich data sources for those who wish to perform large-scale analysis of cultural artifacts.

But it is important realize that, like all data, metadata is not unbiased. Both the raw, descriptive data itself and the mechanisms of storage and delivery introduce particular perspectives that facilitate certain types of scholarly questions and preclude others. This unit introduces the metadata strategies most widely used by cultural heritage institution with a particular eye towards their unique advantages and limitations.


General Types of Metadata
----------------------------

There are two primary types of metadata:

**1.  Unstructured Data:**  Unstructured data present information about objects in a non-normalized, unstructured manner. For example, a collection of reader's free text notes about items in a collection is unstructured data. Unstructured data can contain a tremendous amount of information about an artifact, and it is particularly flexible in its ability to present nuanced information. But unstructured data requires a tremendous amount of pre-processing, including the application of advanced text mining techniques, to be of much computational use. As such, digital metadata standards tend to favor structured representations of data, as described below.

**2.  Structured Data:**  Structured data imposes, as the name implies, a structure on the metadata being captured and represented. Structured data systems establish pre-defined categories, or fields, of information to be captured (such as, for example, Author, Date, and Title), and they also frequently enforce, or at least suggest, rules for what can go into each data field. Both the traditional library catalog and a spreadsheet of items that assigns values to columns (for example, an author column or a data column) are structured data. 

Defining Structures for Structured Data: Frameworks and Standards
----------------------------

The overall value of structured data is directly proportional to the extent to which both individual and communities of cataloguers apply the same structure to data descriptions of multiple artifacts. If catalogers used a different structure each time they described a new object, the data they produce, would, from a practical standpoint, cease be structured, because the type of data being collected and the mode of representing that data would vary too widely to allow analysis across records.  This would render it impossible or, at a minimum, difficult, for example, for a computer to look across large collections and find all works created by the same individual, or to easily analyze publication rates by date.

To address this problem, cultural heritage institutions typically adhere to strict, common sets of rules that define appropriate data structures for particular types of artifacts. In common parlance (as opposed to computing parlance), these rules are typically known interchangeably as Frameworks or Standards. Frameworks have the advantage of normalizing data across many collections. However, they have the concomitant effect of restricting both the depth and breadth of description. A frequent problem encountered by cataloguers is that the defined structures in which they are required to work may provide no way of representing something of interest in or on an artifact being described.

The above problem has led, over time, to the evolution and adoption of multiple frameworks for instantiating structured data, each of which speaks to a particular type of object (book, work of art, etc.), the type of institution creating the data (library, museum, etc.), or the perceived use of the data (contained catalog, networked data, etc.). Below is a list, including brief descriptions and links to relevant documentation, of the most common Frameworks currently being used by cultural heritage institutions.

Note that there is insufficient time in a course of this nature to cover all of the many cultural heritage relevant metadata frameworks in detail, but you will work directly with several in other course modules, at which time you will dive more deeply into each.

Framework vs. Format
----------------------------

As noted above, frameworks provide instructions or standards that define the particular fields that are available to a cataloguer when describing an object as well as the allowable values that can be placed in those fields. In the computational world, when we speak of Format we are speaking of the specific way that data is stored on the computer, in memory, or in analogue form. Frameworks are concerned with the content of a description, whereas Format simply describes the storage mechanism, or serialization in computional language, of the data. Common formats currently in use include: XML, ASCII-File, Realational Database, Binary, etc.

Metadata Frameworks Commonly Implemented by Libraries
----------------------------

Library metadata is typically presented in one of the following three primary Frameworks:


1.   [MARC (MAchine-Readable Cataloguing) Standard:](https://www.loc.gov/marc/)  MARC was developed by the Library Congress in the 1960's in order to provide a standard structure for library catalogues in order to facilitate machine storage, transfer, and retrieval of library metadata. The original set of MARC rules was based on the data fields found on the typical printed on the physical cards of the library card catalogue. MARC grew over time into a complex, rich, standard for representing structured metadata about books. MARC records are typically stored on the computer as non-human-readable, binary files. However, they can also be rendered as human readable XML files. MARC still serves as the primary data format for Worldcat and most library cataloguing systems.
2.   [BIBRRAME:](https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/)  In response to the ever-growing depth of information available over the World Wide Web, several years ago the Library of Congress began developing this new Framework for structured bibliographic data. It is specifically designed to function in the networked world of Linked Data, as opposed to the older, central repository world of the contained library catalog. While libraries have devoted a tremendous amount of time, energy, and money to transitioning to Linked Data, as of today MARC remains the mainstay of library structured data representation. You will learn more about the specifics of linked data in a future module of this course.
3.   [Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS):](https://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/) MODS was developed in 2002 by the Library of Congress to provide a text-based (XML) format for exchanging metadata contained in MARC records.  Many people consider MODS to be a framework in its own right.  Technically, however, it should more correctly be thought of as an alternate format of the MARC framework.



Metadata Frameworks Commonly Implemented by Archives and Special Collections
----------------------------

Because Archivists and Librarians who work in Special Collections deal with more varied collections and have traditionally (but not exclusively) been more concerned with the physicality of the items in their collections than other collectors, Archives and Special Collections have evolved their own frameworks for digital description. The most widely used of these include:


1.   [Encoded Archival Description (EAD):](https://www.loc.gov/ead/) EAD is a metadata standard for describing archival materials that is officially maintained by the Library of Congress. The Archives and Special Collections community has largely consverged on EAD as the standard of choice for archival description. It is common practice in many institutions to maintain both MARC and EAD records for archival objects in order to maximize discovery across systems.
2.   [Functional Relations for Bibliographic Records (FRBR):](https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/frbreng.pdf) FRBR is an additional framework for describing archival materials that is specifically focused on representing the relationships between objects. For example, it provides mechanisms for documenting that different copies of the same book are part of the same print edition and also that multiple editions are representations of the same narrative. FRBR descriptions frequently appear in conjunction with other descriptive frameworks as a means of capturing both relational information and detailed descriptive information about the particular item being described.


Metadata Framweworks Commonly Implemented for Digital Collections
----------------------------

Digitized Collections of historical, non-digital materials present their own set of descriptive challenge, because the descriptive framework(s) used must provide information about both the original artifact (book, print, etc.) and the digital image (called a surrogate) of that original object that is held in the digital collection. The most widely used frameworks for the description of digital collections include:


1.   [Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS):](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/) METS is maintained by the Library of Congress as a general standard for communicating administrative and structural information about collections. While it is suitable for use with any type of collection, its primary uptake has been amongst institutions maintaining digital collections.
2.   [Functional Relations for Bibliographic Records (FRBR):](https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/frbreng.pdf) FRBR or FRBR-Like Frameworks (described above) are also widely used by digital archivists to describe the relationship between digital surrogates and their analog originals.
3.   [Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI):](https://dublincore.org/) The DCMI evolved in the early days of the World Wide Web as a means of inserting metadata into the code behind webpages. It presents a minimal (sparse, in computing terminology) set of fields and rules for describing digitally presented content. Many Libraries and Museums use DCMI standards to deliver metadata about digital objects presented on the Web.
4.   [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIF):](https://iiif.io/technical-details/) IIF was specifically created as a framework for communicating metadata about digital images. IIF is focused primarily on the digital image itself as the primary object of description. As such, when used in the context of digital collections of historical materials it is typically combined with another metadata framework to provide a complete description of both the digital surrogate and its analog original.



Metadata Framweworks Commonly Implemented by Textual Scholars and Full-Text Archives
----------------------------


Textual scholars were amongst the first adopters of digital technologies in the cultural heritage domain and the [Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)](https://tei-c.org/) formed and began to develop its own standard for digitally representing textual data in 1987 based on an early body of work reaching back to the 1950's. The TEI standard includes a framework for both describing a text using metadata and encoding textual analysis within the digital text. The "TEI Header," which encodes the metadata associated with an encoded text is often a rich source of textual metadata.

Metadata Framweworks Commonly Implemented by Musical Scholars and Musical Archives
----------------------------

[The Music Encoding Initiative (MEI)](https://music-encoding.org/), like its textual counterpart, TEI, provides a framework for encoding music that includes structures for both directly encoding musical score and capturing metadata about a composition or recording.

Fields and Field Types in Structured Data
----------------------------

Each of the metadata Frameworks and Standards described above defines a specific set of fields that constitute the complete description of an object. These fields define (and limit) what can be said about an object. If, as a cataloguer, you want to say something about the color of an abject but the framework in which you are working does not define a color field, then it is impossible, to say anything in a structured way about the color of an object using that framework.

In addition to defining the set of metadata fields that are available, metadata Frameworks typically also define what kind of data can go into each field. Generally speaking, three basic types of data can be found in bibliographic records:


1.   **Free Text:**  Most frameworks include some fields in which the user is able to enter free, unstructured text. This usually occurs as a "note" field of some type.
2.   **Controlled Vocabulary:** Controlled vocabularies are lists of words (a vocabulary) that define the range of values that can be put into a field. By flat, we mean that no, or minimal, relationships are defined between items in the list. The [Getty Union List of Artist Names (ULAT)](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/) is an example of a controlled vocabulary. Another, slightly more complex example is the [Library Of Congress Subject Headings](https://www.loc.gov/librarians/controlled-vocabularies/).  The LCSH is liminal as a controlled vocabulary because it allows the use of hyphens to nest entities on the list. However, because it does not have an enforced hierarchical and nested structure, we generally still consider it to be a controlled vocabulary. 
3.   **Ontology:**  Controlled vocabularies provide a dictionary of terms that are allowed to appear in an associated structured data field, but they do not try to map the relationships between these words or to semantically map the domain universe that they describe. Ontologies do just that. They are nested, tree-like knowledge structures wherein each node (or class) defines an allowable entry in an associated, structured data field, and each edge (or branch off of that node) defines that node’s relationship to other nodes in the system, leading ultimately to the system root. The figure below, for example, depicts the top level of the FRBR ontology, which maps the relationship between individual printed copies of texts and the editions and print runs from which they resulted, leading ultimately to the abstract, conceived work that they represent. Unlike controlled vocabularies, which simply limit the allowable values from which a cataloguer can choose, ontologies impart semantic information about the object being described.

The Most Used Controlled Vocabularies
----------------------------

There are literally thousands of controlled vocabularies in use today, but only a few are used widely by the bibliographic community.  The list of vocabularies of which you should be most aware incudes:

The [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/librarians/controlled-vocabularies/) publishes several controlled vocabularies (authorities) that are used widely.  These include:

1.   Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)
2.   Library of Congress Name Authority
3.   Library of Congress Subject Authority
4.   Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms for Library and Archival Materials (LCGFT)
5.   Library of Congress Medium of Performance Thesaurus for Music (LCMPT)
6.   Ethnographic Thesaurus (AFSET)
7.   Thesaurus for Graphic Materials (TGM): Subject and Genre Terms
8.   RBMS Controlled Vocabularies: Controlled Vocabularies for Use in Rare Book and Special Collections Cataloging

[The Virtual International Authority File (VIAF)](https://viaf.org) also maintains a comprehensive, common set of controlled vocabularies that aligns the various international versions of each vocabulary.

[The Getty Getty Vocabularies](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/) are a collection of art and museum related controlled vocabularies compiled, maintained, and made publicly available by the Getty Foundation.  These include:


1.   Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT)
2.   Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN)
3.   Cultural Objects Name Authority (CONA)
4.   Union List of Artist Names (ULAN)
5.   Getty Iconography Authority (IA)
6.   Categories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA)

[The Association of College Research Libraries' (ACRL) Rare Books and Manuscripts Section (RBMS)](https://rbms.info/vocabularies/) also publishes several controlled vocabularies.  These include:


1.   Binding Terms
2.   Genre Terms
3.   Paper Terms
4.   Printing and Publishing Evidence
5.   Provenance Evidence
6.   Type Evidence


The Most Commonly Used Ontologies
----------------------------



There are, literally, thousands of ontologies in use across the internet today. The following is a list of the ontologies most commonly used by digital bibliographers:


1.   [BIBO](https://bibliontology.com/) is an ontonolgy created specifically to capture bibliographic information.  It is used in several Linked Data frameworks.
2.   The International Council of Museums' (ICOM) International Committee for Documentation (CDOC) publishes a Conceptual Reference Model, knows as the [CDOC-CRM,](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/) which provides "definitions and a formal structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage documentation and of general interest for the querying and exploration of such data.  
3.   [Iconclass](http://www.iconclass.org/) is an ontology that models the semantic content of visual images.  While not without limitations, it widely accepted as a subject tagging standard in the digital collections community.
4.   [Friend of a Friend (FOAF)](http://www.foaf-project.org/) is a simple ontology for describing relationships between people.
5.   [The Music Ontology](http://musicontology.com/), as te name implies, is an ontology for describing musical compositions.


Defining an Ontology
----------------------------

Modern, computational ontologies are constructed using the [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://www.w3.org/OWL/) as defined by the World Wide Web Consortium. While OWl can get quite complicated, its basic structure is quite simple. 

1.   All OWL ontologies are tree-like in structure, growing from a single, starting node, often referred to as a "generic object" of "blank node." For example, we might develop an ontology with a “sustenance” node as the first node off the blank node.  We could then have "food" and "drink" nodes on separate branches off of the “sustenance node”, and, subsequently, "soft drink", "beer", and "wine" nodes each on separate branches off of the drink node.
2.   Another word typically used to describe each node in an ontology is "class." Classes are the focus of most ontologies. Classes describe concepts in the ontology's domain. For example, the class “wine” represents all wines. Specific wines are instances of this class.
3.   Classes can have properties associated with them. For example, a "book" class might have a "subject" property.
4.   Classes can have defined relationships with each other, for example one might specifically note in the definition of an ontology that two classes are the same as or extensions of each other.

Ontologies represented as OWL can be both created and examined using the [*Protégé*, open-source, ontology editor](https://protege.stanford.edu/).



Activity
----------------------------

This module's activity is to create a simple ontology of your own using [WebProtégé](https://webprotege.stanford.edu/), Stanford University's free, hosted version of Protégé.  You must sign-up for a free account in order to complete the activity.

Once you have your account, choose one of the four artifacts linked below to work with.  Imagine that you have the physical item actually in front of you and create an ontology that will allow you to successfully describe the chosen object.  Be prepared to share and discuss your ontology with the rest of the class during the post activity discussion to follow.

Choose your object from the following list:


1.   [Revolutionary War Era Printing Plate](https://www.concordmonitor.com/New-Hampshire-Currency-printing-plate-20629659)
2.   [Box of Type](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Box_of_type.jpg)
3.   [3D Painting](http://en.people.cn/102774/8042277.html)
4.   [Casket](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/464236)
